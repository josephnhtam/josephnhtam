### Hi there 👋

Here are some of the open-source projects I've worked on:

- 📡 [live-streaming-server-net](https://github.com/josephnhtam/live-streaming-server-net): An RTMP live streaming server.
- 🎥 [vsp-youtube-clone-microservices](https://github.com/josephnhtam/vsp-youtube-clone-microservices): A YouTube clone using a microservices architecture.

If you find my work interesting or useful, please consider giving them a ⭐️. Thank you!
